This document describes ZeroVM return codes
(up to date 2014-09-04, needs editing)

normally zerovm returns 0 and it means that session terminated successfully.
in case of error zerovm return value from the list below. please note that
codes 1..63 reserved for zerovm setup / debugging and codes 64..255 reserved
for the session errors

00. ZERR_OK. zerovm terminated successful. no attention needed.
01. ZERR_SIG_1. SIGHUP caught. this error could come from the daemon code

06. ZERR_SIG_6. SIGABRT. usually triggered by assert. see zbroker code
07. reserved
08. ZERR_SIG_8. SIGFPE. invalid operation (e.g. division by 0). not seen yet

34. ZERR_SYS. system error. see syslog for details

NOTE:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
main reason why zerovm / session return codes list was upgraded is to provide
fast and easy way (without visiting syslog) to know particular cause of failure.
another reason is to give host program extensive information which allow more
control of zerovm / session. in a few words: debugging and control.

NOTE:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
disregard session return code (from report) if zerovm returned non zero

NOTE:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
in the future list of return codes can be extended. existing codes will not
change since this list should become the part of api when zerovm will be
converted to library
