### Eclipse CDT installation
   1. If your system doesn't have JRE, install a recent JRE. 
   2. Download Eclipse CDT from the [Eclipse download site][eclipse-dl]. No installation necessary, just unpack and run executable.
   3. Download and install [EGit plugin][egit-plugin] for Eclipse
   4. Point EGit to `git://github.com/zerovm/zerovm.git` and pull the most recent ZeroVM sources.
   5. Select 'create C/C++ project from makefile" to create a new Eclipse project.
   6. Run the makefile to build the project and run tests.

   If everything is ok you will see output of the unit tests. Now if you've got `* test has passed` messages, you have successfully compiled ZeroVM for your platform! You'll find the `zerovm` executable in the project root directory.
